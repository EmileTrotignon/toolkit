# Emile's Toolkit

This is a metapackage for common ocamltools.

It includes :
  - dune
  - ocamlformat
  - ocaml-lsp-server
  - odoc
  - dune-release

Instead of typing :
    `opam install dune ocamlformat ocaml-lsp-server odoc dune-release`

Just type `opam install emiles_toolkit` !

I am responsible for none of these tools, this just a convenient way to install 
them.
